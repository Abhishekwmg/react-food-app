                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>We help ambitious teams invent and ship digital products — from discovery to scale. Our work blends research, elegant design, and pragmatic engineering so our partners can move faster and build with confidence.</p>

                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>To create digital experiences that are useful, inclusive, and delightful — and to build long-term partnerships that grow value for people and businesses.</p>

                <h3>Our Values</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>People first:</strong> Start with human needs, not features.</li>
                    <li><strong>Craftsmanship:</strong> High-quality work, iterated quickly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Radical clarity:</strong> Communicate openly, ship measurable outcomes.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How We Work</h3>
                <p>We pair product discovery sprints with rapid prototyping. Early user feedback guides product decisions and reduces risk — then our engineering team drives the build with a focus on performance, accessibility, and maintainability.</p>
